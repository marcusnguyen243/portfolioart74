       <i>Artist’s Statement</i> <br /><br />
	The growing apathy of our nation towards the brokenness of this world is incredibly disheartening. As Americans, we are among the most privileged people in the world, with most citizens inherently having access to things that people in third world countries would consider the highest of luxuries. As we lavish in the comforts, prosperity, and relative ease of the American life, millions of people across the globe struggle to survive. Civil wars, governmental corruption, and inescapable poverty are horrific aspects of life mostly uncommon to Americans but known all too well by many across the globe. For many people, their only hope of survival is through fleeing their country. However, as our government continues to lower the number of immigrants allowed into America, the hope of finding a safe haven soon becomes akin to the chances of winning the lottery.
	Through Walls, I wanted to depict the experience of a denied immigrant. The hallway leading up to the bright white light is symbolic of the immigrant’s past: through the darkness and dreariness of the atmosphere, as well as with the sense of fear emanating from within the walls, the life the immigrant is trying to escape from is represented. Whether it be from civil unrest, extreme poverty, or governmental corruption, the immigrant traverses through this dreary pathway in order to someday reach the “light at the end of the tunnel,” representative of a better life in America. However, as they near the end of their journey, they find that they are barred off from entry. With every passing year, our government continues to drastically lower the number of immigrants allowed into America. Walls represents the heartbreak of the immigrant unable to escape.
	Upon researching and learning more about the Syrian refugee crisis, my heart was moved for them. As of 2019, our government has almost completely halted Syrian refugee immigration into America, leaving hundreds of thousands of Syrians destitute, and wondering if they will survive another day. While Walls is a more broad piece about immigration, the Syrian refugee crisis is what directly inspired me.
