      <i>Artist’s Statement</i> <br /> <br /> 
	Lamentations draws heavy conceptual inspiration from the Book of Lamentations, a book from the Bible documenting the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem in 597 B.C.. Within the Book of Lamentations, the anonymous authors describe the horrors seen before them as they watch the city of Jerusalem being reduced to ruins, highlighting the chaos and the pain experienced by the nation of Jerusalem. The prophet Jeremiah, a biblical prophet who was present during the siege, is the man depicted in Lamentations. 
 The Book of Lamentations is a book of juxtaposition; the themes of agony and grief are continuously contrasted with the hope found in God, and the author’s praise of God in nearly every chapter. In Lamentations, I wanted to portray this contrast. The figure present in Lamentations is the prophet Jeremiah. Though most of his face is hidden by shadows, his body language shows he is struck with grief. The broken walls of code, in addition to the error screens, symbolize the chaos of Jerusalem’s fall. Around Jeremiah’s head are Windows text boxes, telling him to lift his eyes up, and to hope in God. Just as grief and hope are contrasted within the Book of Lamentations, I wanted to do the same with the glitched aesthetic, and the Windows text boxes.
As I was reading the Bible, I came across the Book of Lamentations. The strong sense of agony portrayed in the book, as well as the hope found in God immediately captured my attention. Reading through the book, I felt compelled to make that as the premise of my assignment, because the strong contrast of emotions present within the Book of Lamentations inspired me, and I had found it personally relatable, in my walk as a Christian. Given that the topic of our assignment is on emotion, I figured that the Book of Lamentations would be a good source of inspiration.
